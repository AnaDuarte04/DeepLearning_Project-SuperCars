# DeepLearning_Project-SuperCars
This project was made as a group for the Introduction to Deep Learning module.
The goal of this project is to develop and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for multi-classification of supercar logos.
The initial dataset is available on Kaggle and contains around 30 images for each car brand, and these are distributed across 15 different brands.
As the initial dataset presents a relatively low amount of data to train these types of models, a collection of images of these car brands was carried out in order to increase the size of the dataset used to train the CNN. The dataset was then increased to about 80-100 images for each brand for training and about 5 images for testing. Additionally, 1 image of each brand was placed in a folder to perform single prediction.
